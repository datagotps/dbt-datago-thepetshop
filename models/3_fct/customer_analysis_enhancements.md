## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: CLV, Category Affinity, Price Sensitivity
2. **Medium Priority**: Geographic Insights, Payment Behavior, Returns
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced Segmentation, Behavioral Flags

## Data Requirements
- Additional source tables needed for some metrics
- Integration with external systems (email, support, etc.)
- ML models for predictive metrics
